Mobile HTML Themes 
================

Mobile HTML Themes was a final year University project by Tom Christian. The purpose of Mobile HTML Themes is to build, customise and download mobile compatible websites built upon the jQuery Mobile Framework.

Check out a live demo here: http://mobilehtmlthemes.tomchristian.co.uk/

This project is purely experimental and isn't currently in a fit enough state for actual use (obviously...).

(If anyone cares, I received 88% for this project which contributed hugely towards me receiving a First in my degree :-) )
