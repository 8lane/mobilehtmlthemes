Mobile HTML Themes 
================

Mobile HTML Themes is a final year University project by Tom Christian. The purpose of Mobile HTML Themes is to build, customise and download mobile compatible websites built upon the jQuery Mobile Framework.

This project is purely experimental and isn't currently in a fit enough state for actual use (obviously...).
